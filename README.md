To provide a clear walkthrough of the analysis and dashboard, I created a video presentation that explains the goals, methodology, and insights of the **Return Rate Analysis Project**.  

## **Overview**
This Tableau project explores **Return Rate Analysis** to identify trends, root causes, and actionable insights for product returns. By analyzing returns across categories, time periods, and regions, the project helps in understanding the correlation between sales and returns while highlighting key problem areas.

## **1. Project Goals**
The goals of the **Return Rate Analysis** are as follows:
1. **Understand Return Trends**: Identify patterns in return rates over time, categories, and geography.  
2. **Uncover Root Causes**: Analyze correlations between sales and return rates to find underlying issues.  
3. **Measure Impact**: Use key metrics like **Return Rate**.  
4. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Develop recommendations to minimize return rates and financial losses.  
5. **Interactive Monitoring**: Build a dynamic Tableau dashboard for real-time return rate analysis.
